  # A Social Net
  

  
  ## Description: 

  A Social Net is an API for a basic, but nonexistent, social network web app that allows users to execute rudimentary actions such as creating a user, sharing their thoughts, adding friends, and reacting to the thoughts of their friends. The application uses `Express.js` for router instantiation, `MongoDB` as its NoSQL database, and the `Mongoose ODM`. `Day.js` was also used to re-format the timestamp that is created by MongoDB. This application is not deployed and will need to be used in conjunction with `Insomnia` or something similar to display the API data-models that are generated.

  ## Usage: 

  The user can test out the various API routes using a tool such as Insomnia. The user can create a User, get all users or a single user by id, delete a user, and add friends to a user. A user's associated thoughts can also be tested in a similar fashion (GET by both all and id, POST, PUT), and reactions can also be created and deleted for any thought that a user creates.
